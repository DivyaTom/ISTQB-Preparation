Chapter 6: Test Tools ⚙️ (20 minutes)
This chapter talks about tools that help with testing.

6.1 Tool Support for Testing
==================================
Many types of tools help with testing activities:
• Test Management Tools: Help manage requirements, tests, defects, and configurations.
• Static Testing Tools: Help with reviews and static analysis.
• Test Design/Implementation Tools: Generate test cases and test data.
• Test Execution/Coverage Tools: Automate running tests and measure coverage.
• Non-functional Testing Tools: Perform tests that are hard to do manually (e.g., performance testing).
• DevOps Tools: Support continuous integration/delivery pipelines.
• Collaboration Tools: Help teams communicate.
• Scalability/Deployment Tools: (e.g., virtual machines, containers).
• Even simple tools like spreadsheets can be used for testing.

6.2 Benefits and Risks of Test Automation
===========================================
Simply buying a tool doesn't guarantee success; it takes effort to use them well.
Potential || Benefits of Automation:||
• Time Savings: Reduces repetitive manual work (e.g., running regression tests, entering data).
• Fewer Human Errors: More consistent and repeatable tests.
• Objective Assessment: Provides measurements (like coverage) that are hard for humans to get.
• Easier Reporting: Provides quick access to test progress, failure rates, etc..
• Faster Feedback: Leads to earlier defect detection and quicker releases.
• More Time for Testers: Frees up testers to design new, deeper tests.

||Potential Risks of Automation||:
• Unrealistic Expectations: Believing a tool will do everything easily.
• Inaccurate Estimates: Underestimating the time, cost, and effort to introduce and maintain tools/scripts.
• Using Tools When Not Needed: Automating tests that are better done manually.
• Over-reliance: Ignoring the need for human critical thinking.
• Vendor Dependence: Issues if the tool vendor stops support or goes out of business.
• Open-Source Risks: Open-source tools might be abandoned without updates.
• Compatibility Issues: Tool might not work with the development platform.
• Wrong Tool Choice: Picking a tool that doesn't meet regulatory or safety needs
